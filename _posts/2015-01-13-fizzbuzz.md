The rules are well-known: Print numbers from 1 to N (usually 100). If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"; if it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz"; if it's divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz"; if neither, print the number.

This is obviously a very easy problem, but this is an opportunity to show the use of Julia's ternary operator (`?`):

<!-- more -->

{% highlight julia %}
[1:50 [ (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) ? "FizzBuzz " : (i % 3 == 0 ? "Fizz " : (i % 5 == 0 ? "Buzz " : i)) for i in 1:50 ] ]
{% endhighlight %}

This version is of course not very "pythonic", but after all, Julia is not Python. A clearer version would be:

{% highlight julia %}
for i in 1:50
    if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0
        println(i, " Fizz Buzz")
    elseif i % 3 == 0
        println(i, " Fizz")
    elseif i % 5 == 0
        println(i, " Buzz")
    else
        println(i)
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can use the ternary notation in a block form:

``` julia
for i in 1:50
    i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 ? println(i, "FizzBuzz "): 
    i % 3 == 0 ? println(i, "Fizz ") : 
    i % 5 == 0 ? println(i, "Buzz ") : 
    println(i)
end
```

You can also write the list comprehension on several lines:

``` julia
[   
    i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 ? println(i, "FizzBuzz "): 
    i % 3 == 0 ? println(i, "Fizz ") : 
    i % 5 == 0 ? println(i, "Buzz ") : 
    println(i)
 
    for i in 1:50
]
```
