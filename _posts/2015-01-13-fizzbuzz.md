The rules are well-known: Print numbers from 1 to N (usually 100). If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"; if it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz"; if it's divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz"; if neither, print the number.

This is obviously a very easy problem, but this is an opportunity to show the use of Julia's ternary operator (`?`):


``` julia
[1:30 [ (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) ? "FizzBuzz " : (i % 3 == 0 ? "Fizz " : (i % 5 == 0 ? "Buzz " : i)) for i in 1:30 ] ]
```

This version is of course not very "pythonic", but after all, Julia is not Python. A clearer version would be:

``` julia
for i in 1:30
    if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0
        println(i, " Fizz Buzz")
    elseif i % 3 == 0
        println(i, " Fizz")
    elseif i % 5 == 0
        println(i, " Buzz")
    else
        println(i)
    end
end
```
